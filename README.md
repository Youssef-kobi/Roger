## Introduction

Roger-skyline-1 is a system administration project that involves configuring a virtual machine to meet certain specifications. As part of the curriculum at the 1337 coding school, one of the 42 network schools, this project provides valuable hands-on experience in system administration, networking, and security.

By completing a series of tasks, participants in the Roger-skyline-1 project gain practical experience in configuring and managing virtual machines using VirtualBox, a popular open-source virtualization software. They learn how to set up and secure network settings, including static IP address and gateway configuration and the use of firewalls and iptables to control access to specific ports and IP addresses. Participants also gain experience in configuring SSH access, including setting up public and private key pairs and disabling password authentication, as well as installing and configuring a web server using Apache to serve a static HTML webpage.

Through completing the Roger-skyline-1 project, participants gain valuable skills in several key areas of system administration, networking, and security. These skills include virtualization, networking, security, and web server administration. Successful completion of the project provides a valuable addition to a portfolio, demonstrating skills and knowledge in these areas

## What I Learned

Through completing the Roger-skyline-1 project, I gained a deep understanding of system administration, networking, and security. Specifically, I learned how to:

- Set up and configure a virtual machine using VirtualBox
- Configure the network settings of the virtual machine to use a static IP address and gateway
- Secure the virtual machine using a firewall, specifically using iptables to allow traffic to specific ports and restrict access to certain IP addresses
- Configure SSH access, including setting up a public and private key pair and disabling password authentication
- Install and configure a web server using Apache and serve a static HTML webpage
- Install and configure fail2ban to prevent brute force attacks

By completing this project, I was able to develop my skills in several key areas of system administration, networking, and security, including:

- Virtualization: I gained experience in configuring and managing virtual machines using VirtualBox, a popular open-source virtualization software.
- Networking: I learned how to configure the network settings of a virtual machine, including setting up a static IP address and gateway, and using iptables to secure the virtual machine.
- Security: I gained experience in securing a virtual machine using a firewall and configuring SSH access using a public and private key pair, as well as preventing brute force attacks using fail2ban.
- Web Server: I learned how to set up and configure a web server using Apache and serve a static HTML webpage.

## Conclusion

Completing the Roger-skyline-1 project was a valuable learning experience for me. Not only did I gain a deeper understanding of system administration, networking, and security, but I also developed my skills in key areas such as virtualization, networking, security, and web servers. By successfully completing the project, I have a valuable addition to my portfolio that demonstrates my skills and knowledge in these areas.
