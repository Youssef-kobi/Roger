# Roger-skyline-1

## Introduction

Roger-skyline-1 is a system administration project assigned as part of the curriculum at the 1337 coding school, one of the 42 network schools. In this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in system administration, networking, and security by completing a series of tasks to configure a virtual machine to meet certain specifications.

## What I Learned

Through completing the Roger-skyline-1 project, I gained a deep understanding of system administration, networking, and security. Specifically, I learned how to:

- Set up and configure a virtual machine using VirtualBox
- Configure the network settings of the virtual machine to use a static IP address and gateway
- Secure the virtual machine using a firewall, specifically using iptables to allow traffic to specific ports and restrict access to certain IP addresses
- Configure SSH access, including setting up a public and private key pair and disabling password authentication
- Install and configure a web server using Apache and serve a static HTML webpage
- Install and configure fail2ban to prevent brute force attacks

By completing this project, I was able to develop my skills in several key areas of system administration, networking, and security, including:

- Virtualization: I gained experience in configuring and managing virtual machines using VirtualBox, a popular open-source virtualization software.
- Networking: I learned how to configure the network settings of a virtual machine, including setting up a static IP address and gateway, and using iptables to secure the virtual machine.
- Security: I gained experience in securing a virtual machine using a firewall and configuring SSH access using a public and private key pair, as well as preventing brute force attacks using fail2ban.
- Web Server: I learned how to set up and configure a web server using Apache and serve a static HTML webpage.

## Conclusion

Completing the Roger-skyline-1 project was a valuable learning experience for me. Not only did I gain a deeper understanding of system administration, networking, and security, but I also developed my skills in key areas such as virtualization, networking, security, and web servers. By successfully completing the project, I have a valuable addition to my portfolio that demonstrates my skills and knowledge in these areas.
